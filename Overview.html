    <p style="text-align:Justify">A new invisible enemy, only 30kb in size, has emerged from Wuhan, China and is on a killing spree around the world: 2019-nCoV,
         the Novel Coronavirus! The first case in Nepal was confirmed on 23 January 2020 when a 31-year-old student, 
         who had returned to Kathmandu from Wuhan on 9 January, tested positive for the disease. It was also the first recorded case of COVID-19 in South Asia.
          Between January and March, Nepal took steps to prevent a widespread outbreak of the disease while preparing for it by procuring
           essential supplies, equipment and medicine, upgrading health infrastructure, training medical personnel, and spreading public 
           awareness. The first case of local transmission was confirmed on 4 April in Kailali District. 
           The first death occurred on 14 May. A country-wide lockdown came into effect on 24 March 2020, and ended on 21 July 2020. 
           As of 16 September 2020, the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) has confirmed a total of 
           58,327 cases, 41,706 recoveries, and 379 deaths in the country.</p>
